(B) 2016-04-28 Use libunwind to print a stack trace on gcc/llvm as this also works with static libs http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/programmatic-access-to-the-call-stack-in-c/
(A) 2016-04-28 Support printing of a stack trace for Windows
(A) 2016-04-28 Use localtime_r to get a threadsafe tm struct
(A) 2016-04-28 Implement some kind of lifetime management using a Singleton pattern with shared_ptr
(B) 2016-04-28 Config file for logger would be nice
x 2016-05-02 2016-04-28 The different sinks should implement an Interface. Objects of this interface should be added some vector and the vector should be used to write the log messages.
(C) 2016-04-28 Support for other logrotation services like newsyslog or LogRotateWin
(A) 2016-04-29 Performance decreases a lot when using std::regex for various tasks
(B) 2016-05-02 signal() handler for sinks. We need a Signalreceiver where Sinks can register themselves for a specific Set of signals. Problem is signal() can only talk to static functions.
(B) 2016-05-06 Propagate exceptions from Sinks to EALogger with std::exception_ptr
