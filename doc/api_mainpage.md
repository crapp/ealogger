# ealogger API Documentation {#mainpage}

## Introduction

The easy asynchronous logger is a blazing fast and easy to use C++ logger library.

## Installation
Installation and dependencies are covered in the [README](@ref README) file

## Usage

As you have already discovered ealogger is extensively documented using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html). The latest version of the API docs are hosted at [github.io](https://crapp.github.io/ealogger).
If you need a local version you can use doxygen to create one. There is a doxygen
config file in the doc subfolder of the project.

The API documentation has two Modules that should be the first place for you if
you want to learn about how to use ealogger.

* ealogger base module:
  The ealogger base module consists of the EALogger class documentation and
  important namespaces and macros.
* sink module:
  The Sink module combines all Sink derived classes. A Sink is used to write to a
  specific target like a file or a console. The module also describes the
  conversation patterns ealogger supports.
